                Collection of Personally Identifiable Information
            </strong>
        </li>
    </ol><p>
        We collect personally identifiable information (email address, name, phone number, etc.) from you when you set up a free account with ConfirmFinance.com or choose to fill out a call back/program registration form.
        <br />  We reserve the right to contact you on the information provided, both email and mobile phone numbers, with the intent to keep you abreast of the program status or any other information that may be required regarding your debt settlement experience with Confirm. This may require us to contact you on your number even if it is listed on the DND list. If you prefer to be contacted on another number, then you must explicitly state the same in your form or call in to our customer service department. In addition, we may use your contact information to send you e-mailers/offers based on your previous program with Confirm and your interests unless explicitly opted out by you.
    </p>
    <ol start="3"><li><strong>Use of Demographic and Profile Data </strong></li></ol><p>
        We use personal information to provide the services you request. To the extent we use your personal information to market to you, we will provide you the ability to opt-out of such uses. We use your personal information to resolve disputes; troubleshoot problems; help promote a safe service; collect fees owed; measure consumer interest in our products and services, inform you about online and offline offers, products, services, and updates; customize your experience; detect and protect us against error, fraud and other criminal activity; enforce our terms and conditions; and as otherwise described to you at the time of collection. <br /> In our efforts to continually improve our product and service offerings, we collect and analyze demographic and profile data about our users’ activity on our website.  <br />
        We identify and use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our website. Your IP address is also used to help identify you and to gather broad demographic information. <br />We will occasionally ask you to complete optional online surveys. These surveys may ask you for contact information and demographic information (like zip code, age, or income level). We use this data to tailor your experience at our site, providing you with content that we think you might be interested in–and to display content according to your preferences.
